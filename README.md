# file-save

## First task - Initialize project on git
- clone project
- create branch `first-task`
- create `hello-world` project in your desired programming language - let's pick java
- run it (it should print `hello-world`) to console
- add .gitignore file and list there files that should be ignored (files that are generated when running, building app)
- add everything to git and create nice commit - about that: check https://cbea.ms/git-commit/ `The seven rules of a great Git commit message`
- so commit message could be "Initialize hellor-world project"
- verify nothing bad is added to git (like compiled classes)
- push to git

## Second task - CRUD with files
- create 4 classes each having `main` method, classes will do respectively:
  - create file `test` with  content
  - append `some word` to the file `test`
  - read content of the file `test` and print it to console
  - delete file `test`

finish the task with commit and push - do this for all remaining tasks

## Third task
- new class - print to the console first 10 numbers from Fibonacci sequence
- new class - print to the console Fibonacci sequence until number 196418
- new class - print to the console Fibonacci sequence until you reach number which is bigger than 10 000 000 000 - so 10^10

## Fourth task
- new class - print to the console the lowest number from Fibonacci sequence which is bigger than 10^21
